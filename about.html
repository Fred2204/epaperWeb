Epaper navigation is directed to all cyclists, but especially those who are using their mobile phones for navigation. The mobile phone often has 2 draw backs compared to purpose made navigation devices: Reduced readability in sunlight and short battery life.
Those two problems are eliminated when using an epaper for navigation. You will need the route to be saved as gpx file on the phone and install the app "TrackGPXonEpaper" from the Google Play Store. The phone is then connected to the epaper display via Bluetooth to show the relevant track section on the epaper display. The display of the phone can then be turned off and the phone can be kept in a pocket or another safe place. This way the phone spends very little battery. It is still using the GPS location service but compared to the display in full brightness, it is saving a lot. It also doesnÂ´t depend on mobile data or any phone coverage. The epaper display itself also spends very little energy because it only needs energy in the moment of updating the display which happens about every 10 seconds. Testing has shown that this is enough to easily follow the track. There is also no underlying map shown on the epaper display. But also here, testing has shown that there are very few situations where an underlying map would be helpful. Normally it is very clear which way to go. And if you do get it wrong, you will notice it very quickly, turn around and get it right on the next attempt. If you are interested in trying an epaper display or if you have any further questions please send an email to epapernavigation@yahoo.com.
